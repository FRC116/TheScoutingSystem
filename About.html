    <h1>EPSILON DELTA PRESENTS: THE SCOUTING SYSTEM </h1>
    <body>
                <p>THE SCOUTING SYSTEM was created by team 116, Epsilon Delta. The team considers scouting to be an important part of competitions and                    the robotics building experience. We decided that we could streamline the process by making it digital, and that it should be available                  to all FIRST teams. Thus, this website was made: the ultimate online scouting tool and database. 
                You’re welcome.
